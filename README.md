# RockPaperScissors
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.

The classic game where the computer selects an option between Rock, Paper or Scissors and compares it against the user's option, and displays both the selection results for each in ASCII ard, it also says if the user won or lost.

It uses an If/Elif/Else to determine the result and the random.randint function so the computer selects one of the options.
